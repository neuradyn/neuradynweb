# Media Migration Plan

## Video Files Audit

**Status:** No local video files (mp4, mov, webm) were found in the repository during the audit.

## Action Items

Since no video files are currently hosted in the repository, no immediate migration is required.

**Guideline for future:**
If you plan to add videos, please upload them to a dedicated video hosting service (YouTube, Vimeo, Cloudinary) to save bandwidth and improve load times.

**Example Embed Code (YouTube):**
```html
<iframe 
  width="560" 
  height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOUR_VIDEO_ID" 
  title="YouTube video player" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" 
  allowfullscreen
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>
```
